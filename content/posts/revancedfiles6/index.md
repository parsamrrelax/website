# Revanced Apk for Youtube

I have explained what Revanced apps are in [this](https://maybeparsa.top/posts/revanced/) post. For better understanding first checkout that post.

## Youtube

Download link: [github](https://github.com/parsamrrelax/revancedapks/releases/download/youtube19.45.38/youtube-revanced_v19.45.38-patches_v5.1.0.apk)

Version: 19.45.3


**It is highly advisable to create your own version of revanced apps and don't trust sources of apks in the internet**

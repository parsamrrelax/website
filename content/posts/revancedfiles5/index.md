# Revanced Apks for Soundcloud, Google Photos

I have explained what Revanced apps are in [this](https://maybeparsa.top/posts/revanced/) post. For better understanding first checkout that post.



## Soundcloud

Download link: [github](https://github.com/parsamrrelax/revancedapks/releases/download/soundcloud2024.06.25/soundcloud-revanced_v2024.06.25-release-patches_v4.13.3.apk)

Apk version: 2024.06.25


## Google Photos

Download link: [github](https://github.com/parsamrrelax/revancedapks/releases/download/googlephotos6.97.0/out.apk)

Apk version: 6.97.0

Google Photos mod enables unlimited backups for google photos on any device by spoofing to be the original Pixel. It uses GmsCore package.



**It is highly advisable to create your own version of revanced apps and don't trust sources of apks in the internet**
